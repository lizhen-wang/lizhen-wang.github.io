Where does research ideas come from?

Interests in this question
======

This question has puzzled me for a really long time. I just have a new thought tonight. 


Starting from the theory and literature is a way. 

Starting from the data also works and might even be highly reasonable. Here are the advantages of starting from the data:
1. There must be something new.
2. For Alan's suggestions: you can start to test traditional theories using these data, and see what are new here.

But still, starting from the data have the risk of asking wrong questions, this is exactly where the literature comes into play.

Maybe the ideal approach is to use these two approaches interactively. 



Aren't headings cool?
