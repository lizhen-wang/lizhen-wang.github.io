This blog is a record of you reflect on yourself for the past half-week. 


How Do Professors Raise Questions?
======
1. Prof. Jia Nan: is this a theory paper or phenomenon paper? if this is a phenomenon paper, then magnitude of impact is important, or this should be a theory paper.
   a related question would be: how to estimate the magnitude
2. theoretically speaking: liability of foreigness - foreigness as liability or asset
3. counterfactual: why do we need contracts to incentivize CEOs?
    this actually is related to the experience i write the climate litigation paper. I struggled a lot on considering why does climate litigation exists, now i understand it is actually related to the phenomenon and counterfactual style of thinking.
4. consider about assumptions underlying theorization. if CEO employment risk increases CSR performance, the assumption is that the market value CSR, is this true?

Daily Activities
======
I’ve always believed that exercising is inspiring—almost every time I work out, I feel refreshed and motivated afterward. But yesterday was different.

Instead of feeling energized, I just felt tired and drained. I’m not entirely sure why, but I wonder if it’s related to how much I ate. In the past, my workouts were often triggered by overeating—I’d exercise to burn off the extra calories or as a way to “make up for it.” That kind of motivation seemed to give me a sense of purpose and even a psychological boost.

But yesterday, I exercised simply because I hadn’t done it for a while. I wasn’t eating much, and there wasn’t that usual sense of urgency or goal tied to weight loss. Maybe that’s why it felt different—less driven, less rewarding, and more exhausting.


My Bad Habits
======
1. Information overload: I suddenly realized that I just can not stand it to let myself doing nothing. I am either working, either watching videos, either exercising, either feeling stress all the time. Maybe after work, it is a great time to get relaxed by doing nothing? continuously inputing too much information actually does not seem to help relieve at all. 

When i asked this on ChatGPT, the answer is really amazing. Inspiring, you can learn from the language and thinking processes. It gives me theories to support its conclusions.


2. I am just so sure that if you dont sleep well, you are wasting all your time the second day, and maybe more since you feel guilty and you are not going to sleep well.

3. When there are just too much information. You can actually rest well.


4. what are the most important topics in journals
issues have scale issues
world-class issues vs. local vs. domain specific issues
