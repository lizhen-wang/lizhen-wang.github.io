This is a reflections of unwillingness to do academic work. 


What Happened
======
wasted nearly the whole Thuesday and Wednesday did nothing.

You are doing great on
======
1. did not eat too much as previously do
2. go outside for lunch and tried something new both at lunch and dinner
3. become more conscious that i am currently anxious and need to make some changes


You can improve on
======
1. Still eat a bit more than ideal conditions, particularly when i am not hungry, i still eat a lot, which i think should be avoided
2. did not go outside for dinner
3. dont be afraid of doing things
4. always focus on the your first priorities, dont care about what other people would say
5. believe in and trust yourself
