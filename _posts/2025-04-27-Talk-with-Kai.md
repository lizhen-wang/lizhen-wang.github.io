Kai
======

I can't fully understand why he suddenly talks about sex with me. 


But I am more dissatisfied by my reactions to his proposal of visiting his home, since after talking of sex, I start to think whether I misunderstood any of his ideas. But maybe I should talk about this in a fun way instead of being direct and boring.


I am always afraid that I am being stupid or silly in interacting with people. And I think this influenced how I reacted to people.


I kind of feeling that I am losing courage to fight with life and feeling tired recently.


I think I should be more comfortable with people saying no. I suddenly noticed that a shortcoming of myself is I do not know how to deal with conflicts properly. And I am too afraid of putting myself and others into an awkard situation. This must be closely related my experience of fight between parents and the tendency to keep harmony and nice to everyone thereafter.
