This blog is a record of you reflect on yourself for the past week. 


Better knowing yourself 
======
1. Exercising is inspiring

   I just found out that exercising is reallying inspring, nearly everytime when i do exercise, there are some little thoughts that comes out. More importantly, after doing exercies, my brain generally feels more refreshed and my body feels warmed up, which I thinks, should be a great time to do research.
   This time it is really important: dont let your feelings trick you & think about things from a long-term orientation & dont let other define yourself & pay to pollute. Now let me describe in more details.
   When i started to workout, i feel that i am so tired, but actually the distance is not so far, which means that you have to put so much effort to go further one little step. So dont let your own feeling trap you, you get to be prepared for a hard road, dont let the small hard times beat you frequently.
   Secondly, you have to look at things in a longer term orientation. The trick here is that do let yourself take some break so that you can sprint. If you only use full energy, you know that you cannot do it for long time. I just think doing research might be exactly the same, so dont blame yourself for taking rests. You need to let yourself feel comfortable so that you are exercited, not worried about next challenges. The important thing here is dont exhaust yourself one time. You really need inputs to deliver the best outputs, so that never feel guity when you take rests. So once you know that you just want to exercise for an hour or say 5 miles, the strategy you take would be different than when you dont know what you wanna do and just trying your best. 

Game playing and life
======
It might be surprising that I have never played monopoly. But this time when i play, there are two rule quite obvious that once you got them, the probability of winning increase dramatically.
1. Buy staff everytime you have the opportunity. It might be possible that these places are of no use to you, but it might really valuable to others, so that by keeping them you are basically keeping an option that may realize later.
2. When you dont have enough resources, focus on the business that requires small investments and wait for somebody to buy it, instead of investing on business with highest returns, yet also requires highest investments, is the key to success. So I am just considering about my academic life, sometimes publishing A is related to the resource endowments you own. Actually, this does not mean that sticking with high-investment high-return business will never win. It is just that this sort of success might be really hard, you need to think about this.

Youtube and short videos
======
I am really addicted to videos, even though watching them leaves, literally, nothing but xerophthalmia. But still, i love to watch them because the tempo is quick and you feel entertained at that moment. I really need to buy some stocks of YouTube.

Anxiety & punishing myself
======
How come missing someone's expectations give me so much pressure?
When i dont want to go to the conference, I punish myself for staying late at night and my heart beat so fast when i wake up. This feeling is not good. And more importantly, this is not good for your body and minds, it is like when you already started to sprint, how can you prepare yourself for really important research and things?

Love yourself
======
Your body worked hard to keep you comfortable. Why just ignore their efforts?
Yesterday, I ate too much, so my stomach does not feel quite good. Then I went to exercise, after which, I feel so much better, and even hungry late at night. 

I suddenly feel that "love yourself" might be wrong. Generally, youself might be bad, but when you want to be a better human being, how can you not torturing yourself? For example, you are fat, but you want to be slim, how come you do not exercise and control eating habits but still be slim?
This is especially true for people who dont have enough resources. If you want to break the constraints from your original family and environments, how come you dont change yourself and indulge yourself to become that one people all want to? So the thing is that dont put happiness pursuing on your work as the first priority, the first thing for being succesful is self-discipline and like what i noticed, carving yourself rationally, sometimes, you even need to be an asshole to invoke your reactions.
