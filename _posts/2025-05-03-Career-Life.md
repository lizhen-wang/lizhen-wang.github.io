This is a record of recent reflections on life and career. 


Key Takeaways
======

1. Be really confident about yourself
2. Stop thinking about inconfidence, but keep thinking how to make people laugh and how to get works done
3. People really dont care about you, especially when you are no one, try to get famous and then start thinking about your image
4. The only one way for you to be happy and energetic is to do the things you really believe and say no to things that you do not like. Or you will be flooded into things that you dont like and be the tool of others.
5. I encourage you to be yourself, be brave, and keep thinking forever. 

Yifan Zhang & Haocun Liu
======

Aren't Yifan, the former dancer, beautiful?


But why do some actors are famous but others are not?


Annie Heatheway & Lawrance & Brake Obama
======
Annie is so beautiful and talented in not only acting, but also singing. Still, American people do not love her. But as long as you be yourself, and love yourself no matter what. Someone will love you.


Actors as famous as Annie and Lawrance have done ridicilous works. It is ok to do awkward works. The only right thing is to keep doing and never stop.
