This blog records studies examining the prevalence of corporations around the world, as well as the causes and implications of this phenomenon.

Interests in this question
======

A seminar titled corporate concentration around the world and a working paper titled are there too few publicly listed firms in the US attract my interest immediately. And just when I strated to write this blog, I noticed that this question actually has been interesting me since my bachlor, yet I am considering this from a different perspective, at that time, my intuition is that corporations are the biggest wealth creators. This is related to the prevalence of corporations indeed since some of the studies find that industries are becoming more concentrated around the world, and that publicly listed firms are becoming more concentrated in terms of market capitalization.

Evidence and findings from the literature
======

[Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1630232X) find that a significant listing gap exists, or the US has less publicly listed firms compared to other countries with similar institutional and economic conditions. The core reason is lower new listing rates and relatively stable delisting rates. They did not discuss a lot on the drivers of new listings since several papers have examined this question already. As for delisting, they find merger and acquisition between public firms the primary reason, followed by delisting for cause and voluntary delisting.

The most inspiring part of this study actually comes from research design. More specifically, I am deeply attracted by how they test the theories they proposed, as well as how they interpret regression results, such as residuals and fixed effects.


In a new paper, [Doidge, Karolyi, Shen and Stulz (2025)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fire.12439) updated their evidence to 2023, the essential findings are the similar with their 2017 paper. Below are the key takeaways of this new paper:
•This research updates Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017) to examine the evolution of the U.S. “listing gap”—the abnormally low number of publicly listed firms relative to other countries—from 2012 to 2023.
•The U.S. listing gap continued to increase after 2012, albeit at a slower pace. By 2023, the U.S. had approximately half as many listed firms per capita as other developed countries.
•The decrease in listed firms in the U.S. is a result of both a lower rate of new listings compared to the period before the 1996 peak, and a delist rate that has remained significant.
•The new list rate has remained generally low since 1996. From 2012 to 2022, the propensity of U.S. firms with 20 or more employees to be listed slightly increased from 0.59% to 0.65%.
•In the early 2000s, significantly more firms delisted than newly listed. In contrast, the 2010s saw delisting rates fall to historical lows, primarily due to a decrease in delistings for cause rather than fewer mergers or voluntary reasons.
•Despite a 46.23% decrease in the number of US listed firms from 1996 to 2023, the aggregate market capitalization of listed firms (in 2023 constant dollars) grew by 197.39% to $48.98 trillion.
•The findings raise critical questions about the causes and implications of this growing listing gap, including the role of the legal framework, market competition, U.S. economic dynamism, and capital allocation


[Roe and Wang, 2025](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4372070) find that although the number of pulic firms halved since the beginning of the 21st century, their economic weight has not. To the contrary, several metrics show that firm growth is steady. Particularly, profit and stock market capitalization have grown faster than the economy, while revenue, investment (capital and R&D investment), and employment (as a proportion of non-farm employment) have kept up with the economy's growth. Not only small firms disappear, but also medium sized firms. And for the reasons, they think that legal explanations such as security laws are unlikely to be the complete story and plausibly not even the most important one. Instead, industrial organization development via changes in the efficient scope and size of the firm or changes in antitrust enforcement might be more relevant. A core conclusion is that "fundamentally, the public firm sector is as big as its peak in number, but differently configured." and that the declining number of public firms is not in itself as worrisome as analysts and some SEC policymakers think.


Greenwald, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2024) examine why the stock market rises and fall. They find that the real per-capita value of corporate equity increased at a 7.2% annual rate. 40% of this increase was attributable to a reallocation of rewards to shareholders in a decelerating economy, primarily at the expense of labor compensation. Economic growth accounted for just 25% of the increase, followed by a lower risk price (21%), and lower interest rates (14%). The period 1952 to 1988 experienced only one third as much growth in market equity, but economic growth accounted for more than 100% of it.


[Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfz007) find that since the late 1990s, over 75% of US industries have experienced an increase in concentration levels. Firms in industries with the largest increases in product market concentration show higher profit margins and more profitable mergers and acquisitions deals. At the same time, we find no evidence for a significant increase in operational efficiency. Taken together, our results suggest that market power is becoming an important source of value.


Ma, Zhang, and Zimmermann (2025) examine business concentration in ten market-based economies. Around the world, they observed prevalent increase in teh concentration of sales and net income over the past century, in the aggregate and at the industry level. Meanwhile, employment
concentration has been relatively stable over the long run. The evidence shows that rising dominance of large firms is a pervasive phenomenon, not limited to the recent decades or the United States, and they achieve a greater scale with relatively few workers. 


[Kwon, Ma, and Zimmermann (2024)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20220621) also find that the concentration of production (e.g., asset share or sales share of top businesses) has increased persistently over the past century. Rising concentration was stronger in manufacturing and mining
before the 1970s, and stronger in services, retail, and wholesale after the 1970s. The data employed by this study comes from the Statistics of Income report (SOI) and the associated Corporation Source Book published annually by the IRS.

This paper is published on the AER, i am actually quite shocked since the conclusions are similar, the most unique things about this study is that the sample period is long, and that cross industrial heterogeity exists.



Aren't headings cool?
