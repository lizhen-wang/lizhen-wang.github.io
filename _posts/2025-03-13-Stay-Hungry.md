Two thoughts today.

Try to influence others, let others do what you want to do, instead of letting others influence you, which in general, makes you feel painful deeply. The rationale is that letting others to influence you would give the power of entertaining yourself to others, you either get disappointed all the time or give up trying to be entertained by others from the beginning, either way, you will tend to feel less control of your life. So the way that you feel the world is interesting and working is by increasing your proactivity and try to influence others so that the work goes as you wish. The way to achieve this is highly related to your capabilities and wisdom, in a world of admiring alpha kind of human being, this means you must make the best of yourself by continuously pushing out your boundaries and never feel satisfied. And this is related to stay hungry.

Don't get disappointed of not feeling the best of you all the time. Being normal is normal actually. So you need to accept that in the process of getting to the final wisdom and work, it is natural that you will look like a fool. (the logics here are not that convincing right now). Anyways, accept that being imperfect is normal, wise people should be crystal clear about this and in general, being ok with others performing like a fool, so you should let yourself stay foolish and less self-conscious, just move on and do things.
