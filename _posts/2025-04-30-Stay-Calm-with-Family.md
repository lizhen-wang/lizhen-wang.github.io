Why am I so angry with my dad's plan to Japan?
1. I don't trust him for decision making because of: a) he listened to the boss and then trusted him without any doubt; b) he did not make his own investigation of which traveling agency or traveling schedule is good; c) his decision making is by no means careful from my perspective.
2. Am I still angry with him blaming my traveling schedule?

The fact that he and my little sister said that my Bankok schedule is always very tight actually hurt me, I have to admit this. But do they have the right to feel unsatisfied? I am the person designing all schedules, accomodate everyone's need, made sure to ask their permissions for each schedule, paying everything. So on the one hand, indiviudals who pay and arrange these things should be forgiven, those who do not contribute but only enjoy should be nice to others. On the other hand, I am not an authoritive decision maker, I tried my best to accomodate everyone's need and tried to make nearly all decisions are made by a decentralized decision making system. It is therefore unfair to blame me for arranging tight schedules. 

But still, it is just highly possible that what I perceive as good is not considered as good by others. Our rhythms of life may just dont match.

At the same time, it reminds me that people would easily get angry/upset with you performing bad, making people feel comfortable and satisfied are by no means easy. This is exactly why I am always feeling tired of interacting with people, because once you take others' moods into consideration, it is very tiring.

My mother is just an exception because she would agree with most of my arrangements. 

Reasons that I should trust him
1. People can only accumate knowledge by experiencing by themselves
2. He is spending his own money, which he should have full charge
3. He is an adult, and he has the right to make his own decision
4. It is highly possible that he would be more happy to travel with more outgoing people rather than family members who may instead put much more pressure on him.

Here is comments from ChatGPT:

This suggests your anger isn’t just about the plan — it’s about feeling disrespected or disappointed by the way he approaches decisions, especially when you put so much thought and energy into yours. Which I think is partially correct, becasue I do looked at the traving schedule from the traveling agency, I find that there are a lot of ambiguous info on this schedule which should be carefully considered before making decision. For example, which hotels are they staying, what are the food standards.
