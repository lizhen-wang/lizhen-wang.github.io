Father
======

Why am I so angry with my dad's plan to Japan?
1. I don't trust him for decision making because of: a) he listened to the boss and then trusted him without any doubt; b) he did not make his own investigation of which traveling agency or traveling schedule is good; c) his decision making is by no means careful from my perspective. 

Reasons that I should trust him
1. People can only accumate knowledge by experiencing by themselves
2. He is spending his own money, which he should have full charge
