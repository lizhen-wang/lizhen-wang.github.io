My questions
------
My key goals: 
1. How to get a basic picture of what finance research is doing?
2. The current states of finance research? Recent trends?

   o Theory vs. practice
   o Topic selection
3. How to conduct high quality research?

   o Data? Theory? literature? spans quite a few topics, regulatory technologies, investments, attention, bias (crowd judging)
4. Which paper do you like the most? And why? Any papers that you suggest me to read?
5. Would you recommend people to start PhD in finance?
6. Time and energy management: you are still highly productive at high-quality research.
7. What are the sources of research questions?
8. How to link research to practice. I kind of get lost. Try to believe in the results you are doing. You have industry experience.
   o Here are two things:

   are our research projects cared by practitioners?
   
   Should we let them care? Or publication game. And from the publication perspective, what types of studies top journals would prefer? Specific to editor?
9. But with this data in hand, do you observe the reality first or look into the literature first?
10. Research tastes?
11. Your research spans really broad topics. And theories. How do you make sure contributions are there and how to manage projects?

Alan's comments
------
1. Your own and independent working paper.
2. Paths. A normal school vs. top schools.
3. 50% 20% 20% time distribution. Read news and all other things.
