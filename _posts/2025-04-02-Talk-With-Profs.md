My questions
------
My key goals: 
1. How to get a basic picture of what finance research is doing?
2. The current states of finance research? Recent trends?

   o Theory vs. practice
   o Topic selection
3. How to conduct high quality research?

   o Data? Theory? literature? spans quite a few topics, regulatory technologies, investments, attention, bias (crowd judging)
4. Which paper do you like the most? And why? Any papers that you suggest me to read?
5. Would you recommend people to start PhD in finance?
6. Time and energy management: you are still highly productive at high-quality research.
7. What are the sources of research questions?
8. How to link research to practice. I kind of get lost. Try to believe in the results you are doing. You have industry experience.
   o Here are two things:

   are our research projects cared by practitioners?
   
   Should we let them care? Or publication game. And from the publication perspective, what types of studies top journals would prefer? Specific to editor?
9. But with this data in hand, do you observe the reality first or look into the literature first?
10. Research tastes?
11. Your research spans really broad topics. And theories. How do you make sure contributions are there and how to manage projects?

Alan's comments
------
1. Your own and independent working paper.
2. Paths. A normal school vs. top schools.
3. 50% 20% 20% time distribution. Read news and all other things.

My questions
------
"Hi Professor Krueger! It’s so nice to meet you. I’m Lizhen, a postdoc at HKU working with Professor Roni Michaely. Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today—I’ve really been looking forward to this."
Background (brief & casual):
"Just to give you a quick intro: My background is actually in strategic management, but lately I’ve been shifting into empirical corporate finance because I love how rigorous the work is here, and evidence/data/empirical results based story-telling and theorizing. That said, I’m still pretty new to finance, so please bear with me if I raise some basic and obvious questions!"
Research Interests (enthusiastic):
"Right now, I’m really passionate about sustainability research, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. But I’m also just excited to learn from you—whether about research, academic life in finance, or anything else you’d be open to sharing."
Transition to Qs (natural lead-in):
"If it’s okay, I’ve got a few questions I’d love to ask—some about your work, some broader topics. Should I jump into those now, or would you prefer to start differently?"
 

Discussion Topics
"I had a few questions come up during your talk that I'd love to get your perspective on - would it be okay if I shared those now?"
About Today's Talk:
1.	"First, congratulations on the R&R! Would you mind sharing which journal is considering the paper?"
2.	"One finding that really intrigued me was how only the environmental dimension showed wage effects. I'm curious - do you think this might reflect something particular about Swedish context, like stronger societal consensus on environmental issues compared to social/governance aspects?"
3.	"Some audience members raised interesting questions about external validity given the Swedish context. With global hiring datasets like Burning Glass now available, have you considered testing whether these findings hold across different country contexts?"

About the ESG Promises Paper:
"I actually came across your other working paper on ESG alignment in mutual funds - it resonated because I'm working on a related project about firm-level ESG talk-walk alignment. I'd love to get your thoughts on a few measurement challenges I've been grappling with:"
1.	"First, on capturing attitudes - while we can identify ESG talk in formal documents, do you think we might be missing anti-ESG sentiment since opposing firms might just stay silent?"
2.	"On misalignment measurement - I noticed you used specific percentile cutoffs. Was there a particular rationale for choosing top 5% talk vs. bottom 25/50% walks, rather than a continuous approach?"
3.	"You mentioned identification challenges during the talk - how are you thinking about addressing that for this paper?"
4.	"Lastly, may I ask which journal you're targeting with this work?"


Prof's answer
------
1. Regarding the idea of using burning glass to test global returns to sustainability jobs. only finding magnitude heterogeneity may not be enough, and it is hard for me to imagine that for some countries, green jobs is related to higher wages. But how about wage returns to social and governance dimensions?
2. As for the future of ESG, maybe we should focus on green products and impacts of sustainability practices.
3. Regarding walks and talks paper, maybe the contribution is a problem for paper publication.
