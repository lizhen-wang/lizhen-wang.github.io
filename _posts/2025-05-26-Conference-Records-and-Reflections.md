This is a reflections of recent conference and workshops, as well as research and academic life. 


What Happened
======
Last week is quite busy and a bit challenging.
Mon, Roni's class. 
Thue-Wed, PhD workshop.
Thur-Fri, Finance conference.

You are doing great on
======
1. Pre-class chat with Roni.
2. Greetings to professors after their presentation, and most of my comments and suggestions received positive feedback, especially from Prof. Duchin and Prof. Giroud.
3. Start to get to know how to raise good questions: e.g., mechanisms (employee mobility for Giroud's study; measuremetn issue for political polarization for Prof. Duchin's study, stakeholder perceptions instead of workforce integration; how many employees have contribution data, voter data is better; Corporate function. E.g., R&D is more democratic; do employees' political attitudes observable to CEOs? a new book on politics in Finance; Talk with Alan on the mechanisms of his study; Lobby is highly strategic, have little to do with ideology; Flammer, exogenous shock-using disasters and social protest data). I feel this is one of the most important thing in your academic career. And you start to know how to raise questions during presentations intead of only when you have time to prepare.
4. Less stressed when your work goes wrong.
5. Good questions raised. Start to think use brains.


You can improve on
======
1. Failed to raise questions and prepare for class papers.
2. Failed to raise questions during presentations.
3. Always focus on research, dont let other things distract you.
4. Pursue extraordinary. Learn from Roni,
5. Improve oral english, start to sit with professors to discuss your research. I guess this depends on your sense on reearch if you are not good at small talks.
6. Let Roni feel satisfied.
7. Make decisions with courage and let others know the reasons behind your selection and decisions.

Qs you should have raised
======
1. How does he feel about yesterdayâ€™s best student paper?
2. How do you feel about each paper?
3. Which one do you like the most?
4. What do you value for PhD applicants? Skills, research tastes, personality?
5. What successful PhDs have done right and unsuccessful one done wrong?
6. How to select good research ideas? Depth vs. breadth in topics
7. How would AI and politics impact the future of Finance studies? Do we have a small group of scholars specializing on this? What are the challenges of this direction? What are the opporutnities or frontiers? Polarization is truly a new phenomenon, transparency? Business-politics? Read extensively? Data? Local politics? Will this be interesting? Since most studies are at the federal level. distant donors to local politicans? Can one be diverse in topics instead of focusing on one? Any recommendations for classic papers in this domain?
8. Time and energy management
9. How to achieve success
10. As AEs or from your experience of publishing papers? What do you perceive as the most important to get published? Or get an R&R at least. Rejection rate of each paper.




You should do
======
1. Prioritize research
2. Pursue extraordinary
3. Participant in academic activities, the shocks are much more than only relying on yourself
4. Make arrangements and try to raise questions in advance. If you need to prepare. Make clear your long-term and short-term goals and only do the most important things!!!
5. Practice oral english. Actually, i feel that people can understand your eng when you talk with them in private, the problem is that you feel stressed to raise question in public.
6. It seems that when you raise questions, you can consider the following aspects

   a) mechanism: alternative explanations? omitted variables? reverse causality?
   
   b) implication: e.g., politically moderate firms become winners? effect size

   c) measurement

   d) sample characteristics, data distribution

   f) findings: nonlinear effects

   e) presentation skills: I love Alan's way of presenting his work, the flow is as follows: phenomenon-gap (measure + endogeneity) + our approach
