This blog is a record of firdside chat with Nan Jia and Aseem Kaul.


How do you define the boundary between market and non-market strategy--and is that boundary still useful today?
======
Nan Jia & Aseem Kaul
1. the boundary is blurred

Nan Jia

Aseem Kaul
1. market strategy is about how you do things, non-market strategy is about how you shape the rule of the law


Are their any emerging topics in non-market strategy today?
======
Nan Jia
1. polarization of society: blue economy vs. red economy
   a. bunch of polarization studies, but it does not mean we have understood everything in this domain;
   b. multi-dimensional concept;
   c. not a segeragated labor market
   d. we need deeper insights regarding polarization
2. new techs
3. many countries are prioritizing security

Aseem Kaul
1. tech comes, but policy is not there, the endogeneity of innovation policy, policies in nascent industries such as drones, AI etc.
2. social impacts


Can Asia contribute to the field? If so, how?
======
Nan Jia
1. reality-wise, Asia is leading; research-wise, not sure
2. draw tech from rival contries. e.g., Saudi Abra drawing tech from China

Aseem Kaul
1. other data sources that may measuring different things. e.g., Japanese data.
2. replication studies
3. It is important to distinguish Asia from China, China is not representative of emerging market or Asia, both in terms of economic, political, and technological systems. Look beyond China.

As Editors, what common challenges do you see in research from non-US or Asia contexts? How to navigate these challenges?
======
Aseem Kaul
1. how to generalizing findings. dont over-generalizing. What can be generalized? What can not? e.g., what does institutional void mean?
