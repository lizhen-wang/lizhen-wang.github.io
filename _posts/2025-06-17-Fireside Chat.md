This blog is a record of firdside chat with Nan Jia and Aseem Kaul.


How do you define the boundary between market and non-market strategy--and is that boundary still useful today?
======
Nan Jia & Aseem Kaul
1. the boundary is blurred


Aseem Kaul
1. market strategy is about how you do things, non-market strategy is about how you shape the rule of the law


Are their any emerging topics in non-market strategy today?
======
Nan Jia
1. polarization of society: blue economy vs. red economy
   a. bunch of polarization studies, but it does not mean we have understood everything in this domain;
   b. multi-dimensional concept;
   c. not a segeragated labor market
   d. we need deeper insights regarding polarization
2. new techs
3. many countries are prioritizing security

Aseem Kaul
1. tech comes, but policy is not there, the endogeneity of innovation policy, policies in nascent industries such as drones, AI etc.
2. social impacts


Can Asia contribute to the field? If so, how?
======
Nan Jia
1. reality-wise, Asia is leading; research-wise, not sure
2. draw tech from rival contries. e.g., Saudi Abra drawing tech from China

Aseem Kaul
1. other data sources that may measuring different things. e.g., Japanese data.
2. replication studies
3. It is important to distinguish Asia from China, China is not representative of emerging market or Asia, both in terms of economic, political, and technological systems. Look beyond China.

As Editors, what common challenges do you see in research from non-US or Asia contexts? How to navigate these challenges?
======
Aseem Kaul
1. how to generalizing findings. dont over-generalizing. What can be generalized? What can not? e.g., what does institutional void mean?

======
Aseem Kaul
1. I totally agree. going to workshops and get feedbacks.


Nan Jia
1. geography is not an obstecles for codified knowledge. the biggest problems come from tacit knowledge, interact with visiting scholars.

Qs from the audiences

Xingcan Zhang to Everyone (Jun 17, 2025, 14:54)
I'm currently focusing on CPAs at the trade association level—are there any underexplored topics in this area that are promising for such as SMJ?

Aseem Kaul to Everyone (Jun 17, 2025, 14:57)
@Xingcan Zhang: Yes. I think one other emerging topic in nonmarket strategy is thinking about alternative organizational forms, which includes industry associations and other cooperative forms (see, for instance, early work by King and Lenox as well as my 2019 piece with Jiao Luo) and thinking about the political strategies of these alternative organizational forms is potentially interesting.

How PhDs find whether a question worth exploring? (Bo YANG)
======
Nan Jia
1. this is not a unique question to Chinese PhDs, it is a common question. nobody can find it out by themselves without referring to mentors.
2. just proactively reach out to faculty members
3. when you reach out to people, you need to be prepared, you need to know what the author is working on recently. e.g., dont reach out to Nan with the Q are you working on SOEs? dont say you are the best researcher. dont say tell me about your research.
4. you need to understand their working papers and how their paper is related to your question

Aseem Kaul
1. the development of communication technologies --> may help a lot
2. be specific on your research question


We are borrowing concepts from other disciplines, but we do not understand them as good as scholars (Srividya JANDHYALA)
======
Aseem Kaul
1. strategy scholars should better understand strategies
