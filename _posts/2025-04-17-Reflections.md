This is a record of recent activities and thinkings of myself. 


Purposes
======

1. To reflect and push myself to work
2. To make my physical body feel good
3. To reduce my anxiety and enhance mental healthy

Alex Ao
======

He is absolutely rich. I feel that I should talk more with him, learn from him so that you can know about Finance and the world of rich people. It is very interesting that he is kind, so just grab this opportunity.

Roni Michaely
======

I kind of start to feel that he does not care much about me actually. Here are the evidences:
1. not telling me that grant is approved. Should I ask him for the results?
2. Not answering my emails and requirements, only when others (e.g., Erica, Kate) agree to talk. If this is related to english, then you definitely should practice more.
3. Ask questions instead of just making reports, treat Roni and Kate as coauthors instead of mentors. 

Working Environment
======

1. not telling me that grant is approved. Should I ask him for the results?
2. If I show in the room, I should talk as much with colleagues as possible to know what they are doing, get some useful information. 

Myself
======

1. always, always, do the hard things first
2. it is interesting that sometimes i have strong feelings of not to work, but after several days of let the time kill me, I start to want to work. I dont know if this is normal or something wrong.
3. it is also quiet intersting that sometimes I just feel that my mind is pure chaos, but at other times like today. I feel quite clear. So this is exactly when I should start to work

Seminars
======
when i feel less comfortable and less confident, i alway feel less willing to interact with people. for example, when my work is progressing smoothly as i expect, i would not wnat to attend seminars which from my perspective, should participate. 

Here is analysis from ChatGPT

It’s not laziness or avoidance — it’s your brain protecting your sense of self.


Instead of “I should attend seminars,” try an alternative reframe: What do I need right now to feel steady again — and will this seminar help or hinder that?
