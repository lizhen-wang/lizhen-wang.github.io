The success of your past-how to attribute
======

This afternoon,when i am exercising, i suddenly realized that:
The reason that I used to be successful might becasue that I am smart or I have high level of self control. It is just that in I live in village, there is not so much thing that are so interesting and playful, there are no games, parties, great interactions between humans, love, friendships, education. In a word, the environment you are living is just, although i dont want to admit, barren. So that comparing to what I have, I just found that learning can be much fun due to: 1) knowing that you learnt something is just satisfying; 2) learning and being succesful is a way to escape from the fucked world; 3) the institution incentives you to feel comfortable to do so, for example, you are taught that learning is the only right thing to do, when you are good at learning, people would endorse you. So learning about what is and how to build causality is so important.

Following this, I start to reflect on the knowledge that have been considered by myself as right and wrong. This is very important in influencing how you look at things and make decisions. For example, I used to believe that I have high level of self-discipline since young but when I grow up, such sort of self-discipline just disappears. Now I feel that it is not because that I have high-discipline when I was young, it is just because you have no choice at that time, and you are doing what is most interesting for yourself at that time. And now since you actually have more options, or at least you start to realize that your options do matters when you grow up, the importance of making decisions on what you want be, what to do and what not to do, as well as time, energy, attention management becomes really important. You have to make your own decisions and take responsibilities. This really reminds me of why I always feel guilty when I return home, one of the biggest problem i believe is that my family actually does not have self-control either. Or to make things less brutal, the first priority of my family member might be money earning, and raising children, and enjoy life, instead of being healthy both mentally and physically. This is exactly the reason why I would feel uncomfortable to stay with people that have different opinions, or say, worldviews with me. Is this the reason to be introvert and less personal? Since you dont want them to influence you, and you are not allowed to argue for yourself, then the only thing you can do is to keep yourself away from them. 

Even worse, the previous successful days might just be an illusion, since the way you disciplining yourself is wrong and insustainable in the feeling that they just do not fit the new world. Say, the brutal self-discipline is driven by your true belief that your family is lacking of money. The starving during college is because your true belief of being a thin girl. And now at your late twenties, these two constraints are gone, eating, late sleeping, forgetting makeups, turn on focus mode become your way of letting go stress. So the natural result is that you eat more and have a bad body.

In a word, the experience and knowledge you accumulated in your previous environment might not be useful at all in this new world. This is exactly the reason you feel less comfortable. The only way to grow faster, I believe, is to talk more with these people about their life and their way of doing business. 

Is going abroad a necessity
======
This is never an easy decision for me.
The things that attract me most is:
1. freedom
2. language


The success of elites vs. general people
======
This question floods into my mind when i watch videos on Brain and He Long, two taiwan comedians. I suddenly realized that a simple way to be successful is to copy what have already been authorized as successful in more developed countries (which i believe is also related to human's pursuit of wealth and successful). Brain is among the first group of guys bring western comedian into Taiwan. We should be aware that they must have made some localization to entertain local customers. This is actually quite true for Jack Ma, Bill Gates. 

However, the success path of ordinary people can or may be different. This is just my hypothesis. More interestingly, thesuccess path of ordinary people in different countries might be also be remarkably different. For example, in China, the most important thing might be the '伯乐', as the old saying goes: "千里马常有而伯乐不常有". I am just guessing that in the US, the most important thing might be experimenting or I dont know, say being free and try everything?


Being succesful in academic world
======
This just makes sense that to be successful in the academic world, you need to play with guys that are most fully aware of the game rules. At least you have bunch of tacit knowledge. I do think this also explains why you feel so uncomfortable to learn business and finance. These are just world that you are too far, you must solve this problem or you will never be successful. I mean it. The only way to learn more on these, I guess, is providing something that is really helpful to them. For example, money earning opportunities. In a way, always saying what you want seems to be a really important way to improve and let others help you because people cant if they dont even know what you want.
