This is a record of research proposals for fundings of ESGRI funding schemes. 


Purposes
======

1. To see what studies scholars are interested in.
2. Why does ESGRI favor certain types of proposals.


Proposal Topics
======

Eearly Ideas
------
Yang Bo. Corporate Political Influence Through Supply Chain Relationships

RQ: Does the establishment of a buyer-supplier relationship between two transactional partners facilitate political activities between them? Furthermore, can a firm leverage its position within the production network to more effectively engage in corporate political activities and achieve desirable outcomes?
<br><br>

Yang Bo. Redesigning China's Watershed Ecological Compensation Initiatives: A Structural Modelling of Transboundary Water Pollution Governance

RQ: How eﬀective have China’s WEC initiatives been in reducing water pollution across major watersheds? What measurable impacts have they had on water quality, employment rates, and income growth?
<br><br>

Shipeng Yan. Commercial Banks and Corporate Green Innovation

RQ: Does the Green Credit Initiative affect corporate environmental innovation, and if so, how does it influence incremental versus radical environmental innovations?
<br><br>

Tse-Chun Lin. The Role of ESG Manipulation in Conducting SEOs

RQ: whether managers leverage ESG information (i.e., enhance ESG profiles before SEOs) to attract investors (sustain high stocks) and secure financing (substantial offering proceeds)?
<br><br>

Tse-Chun Lin. Facial Impressions and Digital Altruistic Behaviors

RQ: how positive facial impressions can serve as powerful cues that trigger altruistic behaviors, which can in turn promote ESG-related causes. In this proposal, we plan to analyze a large-scale dataset of over one million photos of entrepreneurial borrowers on the Kiva crowdfunding platform. These loans are broadly related to environmental and social issues, as the loan proceeds go to underprivileged entrepreneurs in developing economies around the world. We have three preliminary research questions. First, how do facial impressions influence willingness to engage in ESG-related initiatives on Kiva? Second, to what extent does the effect of facial impressions on ESG engagement go through the altruism channel? Third, what are the implications for designing nudges and interventions to promote ESG?

<br><br>

Roni Michaely. Shadow lobbying
<br><br>

Jian Zhang. 

RQ: This research explore these gender differences in environmental attitudes and how they translate into individual investment and consumption behaviors.
<br><br>

Haonan Zhou. Sovereign green financing

RQ: This project seeks to shed light on the incentives from both borrowers and lenders in supporting a sovereign green bond market, with a focus on emerging market debt.
<br><br>

Fabrice Lumineau. Understanding the Governance Mechanisms of Interorganizational Corporate Illegality

RQ: To what extent does hierarchy influence both the success and punishment of interorganizational corporate illegality?
<br><br>

<br><br>

Ansong Zhou. Malthus Meets Romer: Population Growth Under Information Frictions
RQ: What are the macroeconomic consequences of a lack of common knowledge on the magnitude of population scale effects? How should the government communicate with the public regarding population or fertility targets in the presence of such information frictions?
<br><br>

Alan Kwan. The Workplace and Political News Diet

RQ: what is the extent of political polarization at work and how does the workplace affect individuals' political news consumption?

Project Grants
------
Ruisheng Zhang: Climate Values Discovery: Capturing Climate Change Impacts from Earnings Calls

RQ: Using natural language processing and generative artificial intelligence techniques, we study the how, when, and why of analysts’ climate change-related questions, and whether analysts’ questions are related to the value and values dimensions respectively.

Comment: I think i have seen one working paper examining exactly the same question.

Jiang Bian: Second-Order Effects of Gender Bias on Entrepreneurial Perseverance

RQ: We examine gender differences in perseverance in entrepreneurial resource seeking. Specifically, we ask the following questions: 1) Given the pervasive, society-wide bias against female entrepreneurs, do female entrepreneurs interpret grant rejections more negatively compared to their male counterparts, leading to a lower rate of reapplication following an initial rejection, even in a gender-neutral selection process? 2) Do female and male entrepreneurs weigh specific aspects of evaluative feedback (e.g., the average evaluation versus the best individual rating) differentially when deciding whether to persist? 3) What are the implications of such differential responses for gender equality in entrepreneurship, and how might policy interventions address these second-order effects of bias?

Sara Kim: Reassessing Inclusivity: The Downsides of Robotic Technologies in Service and Craftsmanship Evaluations

RQ: The role of telepresence robots in service evaluations: How do consumers perceive and evaluate services provided by employees with physical disabilities when they serve in person compared to when they are remotely present via a robot (i.e., telepresence via a robot)? The role of robotic prosthetics in product evaluations: How do consumers perceive and evaluate products created by employees with physical disabilities when they use robotic
prosthetics (e.g., a potter who makes pottery using a bionic hand)? 
<br><br>

Kevin Zhou: Physical Climate Change Exposure and Carbon Emission Outsourcing
<br><br>

Jeffrey Ng: The Effect of Mandatory CSR Disclosure on CSR-washing

RQ: we define CSR-washing as the practice of a firm overstating its CSR-related initiatives by making exaggerated CSR-related claims that are difficult to verify, selectively reporting only positive CSR information (Marquis et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2020), or otherwise misleading investors and other stakeholders that rely on the disclosures in their decision-making.

Echo Wen Wan: Using Anthropomorphism in Marketing Communication to Enhance Purchase of Near-Expiration Food and to Encourage the Spill-Over Sustainability Behavior
RQ: The current research proposes to use a novel, easy-to-implement, and cost-efficient marketing tactic – anthropomorphism marketing, independent of price cuts, to enhance consumers’ purchase of NE food and drive spill-over sustainability behavior. We argue that employing anthropomorphism in communicating with consumers about NE food will activate consumers’ moral obligation of saving lives at immediate threats, which will increase their NE food purchase and benefit the retailers in profit and reduce food waste. We further propose the moderators at the levels of consumer, product, and policy, that may weaken the effect. In addition, we explore 1) consumers’ satisfaction with the NE food and 2) the potential spill-over benefit on sustainability behavior, when comparing to the price cut tactic.

<br><br>

John Bodian Klofer: Impacts of Mass Immigration on Firms, Native Workers, and Past Immigrants

<br><br>

Heng Chen. Job Meaning and Productivity: A Field Experiment in Environmental Protection Manufacturing

Roni Michaely: The Real Impact of the ESG Backlash: Corporate Strategies and Financial Implications
RQ: we analyze how anti-ESG policies reshape corporate ESG strategies, investor behavior, and governance practices. By focusing on the financial implications of ESG backlash, this study uncovers its impact on disclosures, portfolio allocation, fund flows, and voting patterns.
