This is a record of random thinking.


Purposes
======
1. To capture random thoughts
2. To remind myself to overcome human weaknesses in order to achieve something extraordinary

Research and Game
======
The constant feelings of being lost and frustrated in research are similar to the experience of playing games. The key difference is that games come with an engaging story, appealing visuals, music, interactive elements, and hints to motivate players to keep going. There’s also always an endpoint to a game. In contrast, research lacks a clear direction (though you can rely on professors and knowledgeable individuals as guides).

Attention and Energy Consumption
======
When I begin to deeply engage with my research projects, I realize that the content I previously relied on, such as Zhihu or Twitter, becomes irrelevant. This shift represents a positive transition, as I become more focused with a clearer direction.

Additionally, I emphasize thinking in terms of first principles—the fundamental laws underlying specific phenomena, such as research itself. It’s important not to let irrelevant information consume your thoughts and energy, leaving no room for reflection on what truly matters.

I also believe that procrastination reflects a lack of direction. I now see that one’s actions are a reflection of one’s thoughts, body, and mental state. Procrastination is often the result of not having a clear path forward.


Making the right decision is difficult, to be honest. A quote from Prof. Jianjun Zhang has resonated with me: “Always choose the difficult path.” At first, I didn’t fully understand this, but now I realize its importance. One must remember this advice and push through obstacles to tackle the harder tasks, as this is the path to growth and strength.

Talk with Mukai
======
Mukai shared two opposing views on the co-existence of good genes:
1. One view is that good genes should have a higher probability of appearing.
2. The other view is that once a person has one good gene, it is more likely to be passed down, but the mixing of genes reduces the likelihood of any one individual possessing multiple good genes.

Going back home during Ching Ming Festival
======
The urge to go home and spend time with family conflicts with the need to focus on my research and work. My mom has suggested that I visit, but after careful reflection—particularly considering what I would actually do at home—I decided to stay. I see this as an important step in prioritizing my work and personal growth.
