The idea of blogging comes into my mind somehow mirrors Haruki Murakami's experience of starting writing. Here is his description of that moment in his famous book "What I talk about when I talk about running".

"The crack of bat meeting ball echoed through the stadium. Hilton easily rounded first and pulled up to second. And it was at just that moment that a thought struck me: You know what? I could try writing a novel. I still remember the wide-open sky, the feel of the new grass, the satisfying crack of the bat. Something flew down from the sky at that instant, and, whatever it was, I accepted it.

I didn’t have any ambition to be a “novelist.” I just had the strong desire to write a novel. I had no concrete image of what I wanted to write about—just the conviction that I could come up with something that I’d find convincing. When I thought about sitting down at my desk at home and starting to write, I realized that I didn’t even own a decent fountain pen. So I went to the Kinokuniya store in Shinjuku and bought a sheaf of manuscript paper and a five-dollar Sailor pen. A small capital investment on my part."

But my case differs here that the action of blogging comes much later than my initial idea. Or to be more accurate, I have been writing diaries for many years, but these contents are more like mental medicines where they are primarily used for emotional recovery, now I want to write something more serious and logical, which I think should be isolated from my diaries. Then the action of blogging materializes.

I don't know why exactly writings have been so attractive to me. But it is so true that some genius do blogging or programming or do both regularly, ProgramThinker, Aron Swartz, Shengqiao Lin, Yifu Qu. I love reading their blogs and thoughts at that time. I was thinking maybe regular writing is worth trying. I have been putting much more emphasize on reading than writing, and I believed writing is quite easy as long as you have something to write. And now I am still feeling the same way but I do agree that thinking should be organized and trained on a regular basis, otherwise you are just a greedy information taker (the first word come into my mind is sucker) without internalizing them to your own words. And I believe writing is an important tool achieve this.

So without further due, let us just get started.
